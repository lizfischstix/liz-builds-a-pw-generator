# liz-builds-a-pw-generator

## Description this password generator will help employees who work with sensitive data create a secure password.
in working on this project I learned about for loops and math.random.  While my application is not yet perfected, I will cotinue to practice applying the tools I used to build it to increase my own understanding of JavaScript and its capabilities.

## Installation the deployed web app can be found at https://lizfischstix.github.io/Liz-builds-a-pw-generator/. to start the app, press "generate password" and follow the prompts.
